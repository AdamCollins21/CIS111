ZenRows: 
ZenRows is a web scraping library for python that prevents you from getting blocked by getting passed CAPTCHAs and using proxies. I would be Interested in using ZenRows because sometimes I will get blocked from websites because of my VPN. Hopefully this will help solve that problem. But ZenRows is a paid service so I don't know if it would be worth it to me to continue with using it.
Selenium:
	Selenium is used for web scaping by allowing you to scape dynamic content on the web. I would be interested in using Selenium because it is compatible with both Firefox and Google Chrome. Since it can be used with many browsers, I will not have to worry about it not working if I ever decide to switch from Firefox to Chrome. 
Beautiful Soup
	Beautiful Soup is used for web scraping. It can show data under a documentâ€™s format. It is used for HTML and XML files. It is great for analyzing these files. I would be interested in using Beautiful Soup if I ever want to analyze HTML or XML files. Another advantage of my using Beautiful Soup is that it has a community of support that is active and willing to help.
Playwright
	Playwright is used for web scraping. It can be used over many different web browsers and its purpose is to extract data from different websites. I would be willing to use this because it is open source. But the downside is that it would be very time consuming when learning how to use Playwright. So, I would probably hold off on using it until I have a solid understanding of Python.
Scrapy
	Scrapy is a python web scraper. It can take data from websites, even ones that are very complex. It can also get passed CAPTCHAs. This would come in handy when a CAPTCHA is preventing me from retrieving data from a website. I would be interested in using this but like Playwright it takes some time to learn. So, I would also need to have a good understanding of Python beforehand.
